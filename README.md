## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, I'm Prosper Amamgbo, a Data Engineer with hands-on experience designing and deploying end-to-end cloud-based ETL pipelines using AWS (Lambda, S3, Redshift), Terraform, and Python.

I thrive at the intersection of data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and automation, with a strong foundation in:

- ETL design and orchestration (Parquet, pandas, SQL)

- AWS serverless architecture (Lambda with Docker, S3, Redshift Serverless, Step Functions)

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform modules for IAM, ECR, VPC, etc.)

- Data validation and transformation (cleaning, merging, schema alignment)

- CI/CD practices and Git for version control

I'm currently focused on building scalable, production-grade data workflows and turning raw data into clean, queryable data marts.

Open to internships and full-time roles in **data engineering**, **analytics**, or **cloud infrastructure.**

Letâ€™s build something impactful together ðŸš€
